1. Urban cities have many more drivers and rides than suburban and rural towns.
2. Due to the greater supply of drivers in urban cities, the law of supply and demand is being followed as the average fare in urban areas
is lower than in suburban and rural areas.
3. The nature of travel in suburban and rural areas, where most people have their own modes of transporation, results in a lower number of
drivers needed there.
